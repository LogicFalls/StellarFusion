# StellarFusion
A Faithful 32x32 supplement for GregTech, tailor made for GregTech: New Horizons

This is a project by LogicFalls that hopes to update Faithful 32x32 GregTech, GT++, and GT:NH Core Mod textures to the most recent versions, and (hopefully) improve them.
Huge thanks to the GT:NH Discord server, wherein lies a fantastic community that's been brimming with support and critique from the resource pack's conception.
Particular thanks to:
	Richard Hendricks (aka moronwithmachinegun), a developer for GTNH and felt presence on the Discord, who has been a flagship supporter of the pack from the start and has even made some changes to the mod's code for SF's benefit. Thank you!
	Alkalus, author of GT++ and contributor to GT:NH has begrudgingly given some assistance to integration of that pack. They deserve a thanks, even if they don't want it.
	Tec, author of TecTech and contributor to GT:NH has also given some support to integration.
	
To have the machines in this pack look the best possible, go to
[GTNH instance folder]\config\GregTech\GregTech.cfg and change "B:use_machine_metal_tint=true" to "B:use_machine_metal_tint=false". This way machines will have their intended colouring.
If you decide to stop using Stellar Fusion, it's recommended to re-enable this option.
